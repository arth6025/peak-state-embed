# peakst8 Embed

**A peakst8 product feature.** peakst8 Embed lets a club sell its events on its own website. Event pages rank on Google and get cited by AI answer engines on the club's domain. peakst8 still runs checkout, payments, refunds and check-in, so the GMV take is unchanged.

## Who we're building it for

**ICP:** community fitness organisers and event runners in Indian metros who run paid events, have a website they want to grow, and no in-house developer. Today they list on peakst8 and link out, so the search traffic never builds up on their own domain.

The pilot starts with three organisers:

| Pilot | What they run | What Embed gives them | Go-live (proposed) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Find Your Fit** | Recurring community runs and sessions | Every run ranks on their own site; bookings without leaving it | 30 Nov 2026 |
| **Sisters in Sweat** | Women's fitness community events | Their brand all the way through checkout; one place for all their events | 7 Dec 2026 |
| **Cubbon Classic 10K** | A chip-timed 10K race with club entries (Edition 2, 21 Mar 2027) | A race page that ranks and gets quoted for "10K in Bengaluru" searches, plus club codes and bibs in peakst8 | 14 Dec 2026 |

## The problem

- **Traffic leaks.** Linking out to a ticketing page sends every searcher to another domain.
- **Iframe embeds are invisible.** Google credits the vendor, and AI crawlers, which mostly don't run JavaScript, see nothing.
- **No attribution.** Clubs can't fire their GA4 or Meta pixel on a booking.

## Case study: Cubbon Classic 10K today

[cubbonclassic10k.com/register](https://cubbonclassic10k.com/register) is the setup Embed replaces:

| Today | With peakst8 Embed |
| --- | --- |
| Individual entry is a KonfHub widget iframe inside the page | A server-rendered race page on their domain; peakst8 checkout opens on Book |
| Structured data is an Organization and a WebPage only, with no Event markup | Event, FAQ and breadcrumb schema, sitemap and IndexNow |
| Club captain submits a form; the code arrives 24–48 hours later; 10 runners minimum, 7 men + 3 women | Club codes issued on approval (O7); captain tracks the roster against the rule (C2); members join with the code (C3) |
| Chip-timed entry with bibs | Bibs assigned on payment, frozen 7 days before the race, exported as CSV to the timing partner (O7) |

## What we're building

1. **Hosted event pages** on the club's domain (`events.club.in`), server-rendered, with Event and FAQ schema, a sitemap, IndexNow pings, AI crawlers allowed and an `llms.txt`.
2. **A listing block or Book button** for the club's main site, from one snippet.
3. **One peakst8 checkout** that opens as a sheet over the club's page and sends booking events to the club's GA4 and pixel.
4. **Race features** for the Cubbon pilot: club-code registration (captain registers, members join with a code, roster rules) and bib numbers with a CSV export to the timing partner. V1 doesn't integrate with timing hardware.

Embed is switched on per organiser from peakst8 admin, so the pilot stays limited to these three.

## Open questions

- **Canonical:** if the club page is canonical, the peakst8 marketplace listing loses that search traffic.
- **Pricing:** same GMV % on Embed orders, or lower?
- **Data:** can clubs export attendee phone and email?
- **Payments:** does the gateway allow checkout inside a frame? This blocks the 30 Oct gate.
